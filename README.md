## Biblio: Book scraping project

The current implementation of a book web scraper is designed to gather metadata about books, particularly from the Goodreads page. However, this tool can be upgraded to include more sources for data such as Gutenberg's database. The aim is to eventually create a comprehensive database that incorporates both textual content and accompanying metadata, providing valuable insights into literary studies across various genres.
